# Project 1: Hoodkid

Whiteboard at: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lEOTGaE=/

"Hoodkid" is a 2D top-down hack 'n' slash inspired by roguelike dungeon crawlers. The player will control the eponymous Hoodkid and guide him from his starting position to the dungeon's exit. Hoodkid is controlled using the arrow keys or WASD, and has a single attack: a short-range sword slash controlled by the space bar. Hoodkid will have to find the Key to escape the dungeon, but will be confronted with enemies whose sole purpose is to prevent his escape. 

## MVP

[] A main menu with options to start the game, or read the controls.

[] A HUD featuring the player's current health, and whether or not they have the Key.

[] Multiple instances of one enemy type.

[] One treasure chest containing the Key.

[] A locked door, accessible only once the player has the Key in their possession.

[] An exit, marking the player's success and the game's end.

[] Menu screens for winning and losing the game.

[] Background music.

## Stretch Goals

[] Traps and other obstacles.

[] Dash function.

[] Health potions and powerups.
